####Enter a number and the application will return a range of numbers and some pings and pongs :)
####By: Neil Larion

## Description

###This is a project that a user input using a form and then returns a range of numbers from 1 to the user's input with the following exceptions:
* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
* Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"


This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing. A link to the live site is provided below:
